## Introduction

The goal of this work is to predict the manner in which a group of individuals prefromed a barbell lift based on the response of wearable accelerometers. More information is available from the follwoing website: -

### Importing Data

We begin by importing a dataset that contains data extracted from the acceleraomters, as well as details of the subject, the excercidse they were perofrming and how "well" they perforomed it. We split take the dataset and keep 75% of it for training the model, and 25% for cross validation. For good measure, we also remove columns containing only NA values since they are no use for predcition.

```{R}
trainingdata <- read.csv('C:/Users/Mike/Dropbox/MOOC/PracticalMachineLearning/pml-training.csv')
inTrain <- createDataPartition(trainingdata$classe, p = 3/4)[[1]]
training <- trainingdata[inTrain,]
predictor_cols <- colSums(is.na(training)) == 0
training <-training[,predictor_cols]
testing <- trainingdata[-inTrain,]
testing <- testing[,predictor_cols]
```

Now, if we 



This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
